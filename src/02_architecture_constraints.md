# Architecture Constraints

> Anything that constrains teams in design and implementation decisions, or decision about related processes. Constraints can sometimes go beyond individual systems and might valid for whole organizations and companies (e.g. company-wide technology choices or government regulations). Time and money are common constraints in many organizations.
