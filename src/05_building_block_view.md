# Building Block View

> Usually, boxes and arrows, showing the high-level code structure of the system. To phrase it a little more formal: The building block view explains the static structure of the system and contains, abstractions of source-code. It refines the context view, where the complete system is depicted as a black box.
> - Level 1 contains the major subsystems, components or parts of the system. In some cases, this coarse overview provides enough structural overview.
> - Level 2 refines one or more elements from level 1: Create a separate white box (plus explanations) for every level-1 building block you would like to explain in detail.
